This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## Cats App

This is a single application created with react-redux-toolkit which loads and shows the cat images. There is some features:

- You can select a category for which you want to browse images.
- You can click browse more at the bottom of the page. Each click to browse more button will add and show 10 more images.

In this app there is not used any ui lib. Asynchronous actions created by redux-thunk.
